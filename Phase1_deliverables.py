Key Phase 1 Deliverables:
Week 1: Environment setup, GCP APIs enabled, service account configured, basic project structure
Week 2: Working speech processor, simple flow executor, basic test runner, initial validation
Most Important First Steps:

Enable GCP APIs (Day 1)
Create service account with proper permissions (Day 1)
Set up basic Python environment (Day 2)
Test TTS/STT functionality (Day 7)
Run first conversation flow (Day 12)

What You'll Have by End of Phase 1:

✅ Cost-effective testing (~$5-15/month vs $200-400 with Twilio)
✅ Basic TTS/STT pipeline working
✅ Simple conversation flow testing
✅ Foundation for scaling to more complex scenarios
✅ Initial reporting and validation
